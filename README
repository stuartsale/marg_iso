marg-iso - A program to estimate p(s,A,R|data) for stars
============================================================

Author - Stuart Sale

Intro
------------

This is python based module to estimate the posterior p(s,A,R|data) 
for stars by fitting a Gaussian mixture model, where s is the 
distance, A the (monochromatic) extinction and R parametrises the 
extinction law.

This software accompanies Sale & Magorrian (2015) 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.448.1738S .

The posteriors p(s,A,R|data) can be used in the Gaussian Process
based 3d extinction method of Sale & Magorrian (2014) 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445..256S .
